#TinyBnB

#### A website for small and unique vacation rentals

This is a project for Unit 2 in the General Assembly Web Development Remote Immersive program. This project uses Node, Express, EJS, and MongoDB to create a website to book unique tiny homes.

The inspiration behind this project is a combination of growing tiny house movement and the booming house rental market.
